SURAKSHA - The Women's Safety App

This application was built by keeping in mind the wide range of female audience who would be using this. It offers a smooth and very friendly UI/UX  to look into their safety.
SURAKSHA sends your location details to a list of pre selected contacts when you are in distress. Apart from that, you can always reach the women helpline centre through this app.
SURAKSHA stands apart from other apps due to it's distinguished features of very interactive online Community Forum, Language Support, and Motion Sensors made for ease-of-use.
